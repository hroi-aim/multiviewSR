Main functions: 
1) Triple-view transofrmation, registration and deconvolution in diffration-limited mode and super reoslution mode:
main file: ConfocalSlit_Decon.m which will call 
Confocal_PreProcessing_PTZMode.m if top views are acquired in objective PZT mode
or Confocal_PreProcessing_StageMode.m if top views are acquired in stage scanning mode

2) simultion of system PSF
main file: PSF_Generator.m

3) reconstuction SIM images: 
main file: ConfocalSIM_PhotonReassignment.m which will call Shrink.m

4) joint decon of multiple 1D SIM at different rotation angles:
main file: JointDecon_2DSIM_DL_3views_6angles.m

General functions that will be called in the above main functions:
ReadTifStack.m and WriteTifStack.m: reading and writing TIF stacks
ConvFFT_S.m: 3D convolution
align_size: align 3D data into a specific size
