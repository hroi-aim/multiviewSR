Main functions: 
1) Triple-view transformation, registration and deconvolution in diffraction-limited and super reoslution modes:
main file: ConfocalSlit_Decon.m which will call 
Confocal_PreProcessing_PZTMode.m if top views are acquired in objective PZT mode
or Confocal_PreProcessing_StageMode.m if top views are acquired in stage scanning mode

2) Simulation of system PSF:
main file: PSF_Generator.m

3) Reconstruction of SIM images:
main file: ConfocalSIM_PhotonReassignment.m which will call Shrink.m

4) Joint deconvolution of multiple 1D SIM images at different rotation angles:
main file: JointDecon_2DSIM_DL_3views_6angles.m

5) 1D SIM deep learning training with 3D RCAN:
RCAN_1DSIM_train.py and RCAN_1DSIM_apply.py

General functions that will be called in the above main functions:
ReadTifStack.m and WriteTifStack.m: reading and writing TIF stacks
ConvFFT_S.m: 3D convolution
align_size:  padding 3D data with specific size
