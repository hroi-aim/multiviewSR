# multiviewSR

This repository includes:

1. Matlab codes that transform, register, and deconvolve triple-view line confocal data (either in diffraction-limited or 1D SIM mode), and test data;
2. Matlab codes for modeling system PSFs of line confocal microscopy in diffration-limited mode and 1D SIM mode;
3. Matlab codes for reconstruction of 1D SIM from phase-shifted raw images;
4. Python codes for 3D RCAN training and predication of 1D super-resolution images at different rotation angles from diffraction-limited input;
5. Matlab codes for reconstruction of triple-view 2D SIM from predicted 1D SIM images.
