# multiviewSR

This repository includes:

1. Matlab code that transforms, registers, and deconvolves triple-view line confocal data (either in diffraction-limited or 1D SIM mode), and test data;
2. Matlab code for modeling system PSFs of line confocal microscopy in diffration-limited mode and 1D SIM mode;
3. Matlab code for reconstruction of 1D SIM data from phase-shifted raw images;
4. Python code for 3D RCAN training and prediction of 1D super-resolution images at different rotation angles, given diffraction-limited input;
5. Matlab code for reconstruction of triple-view 2D SIM data from predicted 1D SIM images.
